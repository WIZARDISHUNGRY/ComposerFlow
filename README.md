# Composer Flow 
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gopYkrd.png">
ComposerFlow is designed for teams using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow). It will take a production release of a Composer package and make sure that all changes from the release are merged back into develop and master. Right now it merely checks if the release tags for packages are different than master and develop.
